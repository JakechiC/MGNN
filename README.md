# MGNN
MGNN: Moment Graph Neural Network for Universal Molecular Potentials

# Project Overview
This repository implements a Moment-based Graph Neural Network (MGNN) for predicting molecular potentials, aimed at improving molecular dynamics simulations. The MGNN approach leverages graph neural networks to model atomic interactions efficiently.

Currently, the repository contains one key file, and additional files, including training scripts, datasets, and experimental results, will be uploaded after the paper is published.

# Current Files
